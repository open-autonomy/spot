# OccupyingPlaceV2
The way the electronic driver tells the spot service it has reached a `Place`.  This message must be sent when:
- the truck has reached or just crossed (while driving) the position of a `Place` it has permission to occupy.
- the truck is immobilized at this `Place`; if this is the last permission granted in the chain.
- the truck is the first in the queue. If in a queue, trucks behind the first truck will not send this message until it reaches the front of queue.
