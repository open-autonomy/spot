# Spot Protocol Version 2

This document describes Version 2 of the Spot Specification. Support for Version 2 is indicated by the `Protocol` and `Version` field in the [message header](MessageHeaders.md).

# Changeset
The following table describes the changeset between Version 2 and Version 1 of the Spot standard:

| Change | Description |
|---|---|
| The placeId field for all messages has changed from `uint_64` to `uuid`. |
| the FromWayId field in ApproachingLastMile has changed from required to optional to account for trucks requesting a last mile assignment while inside the destination area. |
| A new OccupyPlaceV2 message has been created in order to simplify communications with the AHT and remove the need for cache management. |
| Removed Cache Management as this information is now fully enclosed in the OccupyPlaceV2 message. |
| Removed all `VehicleId` attribute from messages, and to use top-level message headers `EquipmentId` |
| Added `CorrelationId` in top-level message headers to link relevant messages |

> NOTE: All JSON examples in this documentation are formatted for your convenience and viewing pleasure.  It is not expected that messages exchanged on the wire will contain new lines, tabs & spaces so a human can read it. So the indentataion can't be programmatically relied upon (like that dumb yaml), the formatting is just there to delight your brain. <br> The protocol does **not preclude** the messages to be beautified prettified on the wire if that's what you like.
