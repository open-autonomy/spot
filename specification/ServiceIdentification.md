# SpotServiceV1
The first message sent by the `spot` service.  It identifies that the client is talking to the right service and identifies the highest protocol version it supports.

> NOTE: Security is supplied at the infrastructure level, not at the application level.  The authentication and authorization has already been done by the time the client reaches this point;  so it is considered safe to provide a lot of information on the service beyond this point.

> NOTE: The API version will be incremented when significant new functions are added to the protocol or if backwards compatibility is broken.  Bug fixes have no impact on the protocol version.

> NOTE: In the future, each message could have its onw key:value pair, where the value would be the version number supported by this implementation.  But we are KISSing it for now.
