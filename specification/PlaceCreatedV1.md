# PlaceCreatedV1
This message is sent to all connected `client` applications when a new `Place` is created in the spot databse.  The `Place` can be one of these:
- `Spot`
- `PrimaryQueue`
- `StagingQueue`

>NOTE: It will be rare that multiple spots and queues are created at the same time.  So to simplify the implementation, we have elected to use one message per `Place` created.  Currently places are not expected to be sent as an array or have multiple `Place`s objects per message.

|Sender| Triggered by | Triggers|
|---|---|---|
| `spot` | A Spot or Queue was created in the mine| `client` applications to update their local cache|

## Use Case:
This message is used when an event triggers it in a very special case under specific circumstances.  We hope this explanation clarifies everything and is not too verbose in its layout of the sequence of events that leads to its usage.ðŸ¤”

## Example 1
The shovel operator is preparing to load trucks at a new location.  The operator moves the bucket where the truck is wanted, then through the shovel HMI (likely a digital input) the operator creates a new spot position at ground level right under the current bucket position.
